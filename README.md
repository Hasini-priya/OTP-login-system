# OTP-login-system
🔐 OTP Login System (Python)

A simple console-based OTP Login System built using Python.
This project demonstrates basic authentication by validating user credentials and verifying a randomly generated one-time password (OTP) with limited attempts.

Key Highlights:

Username and password authentication

Random 4-digit OTP generation

OTP verification with limited attempts

Console-based implementation

Concepts Used:

Conditional statements

Loops

Tuples

String handling

Random number generation

This mini project helped improve my understanding of authentication logic and input validation, which are commonly used in real-world applications.
